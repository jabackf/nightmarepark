Nightmare Park - Under development since 11/23/04

Notes:

For some reason, VBA 1.7.2 does sprite mosaic incorrectly. Earlier versions had it right though.

Change the timer countdown method in the make_menu funtion in menu.h. With the current method,
the speed differs from emu to emu.

With the Boycott Advanced emulator, if you get a gameover then replay the game without reseting, the
menu system is all screwed up. Also with Boycott, the WaitTime function needs to be rewritten.
EX. The "GANG OF GHOSTS" message doesnt stay on the screen for long enough.

Dont forget to take out the debug code in gm_gameboard.h
